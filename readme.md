# :memo: loc (Lines Of Code) counter

Counts how many lines of code (LOC/SLOC)* are in a code base, by programming language.

The programming languages are determined via the file extensions.


\* LOC = Lines Of Code
\* SLOC = Source Lines Of Code

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x

## Installation

- Download the [python script](./loc_counter.py) (or download or clone this whole repo)

- Save the script in a suitable location, such as `/scripts`

## Usage

```
cd /my_source_code

./scripts/loc_counter.py
```

### Example output

```
Type                    Files   Lines
Python                  1       377

                        Files   Lines
Identified Code         1       377

Skipped                 2       75
Skipped extensions:             md


Total                   3       452
```

### Detailed Usage

This script scans the current directory and reports several
statistics of interest to code spelunkers:

- total number of directories that contain code
- total number of files in all directories.
- total number of files in each of the following programming
  languages: 
  - SQL, .NET, C#, PowerShell, JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, JSON, ASP.NET, TypeScript.
  Also other languages including:
  - Awk, C, C++, HTML, IDL, Java, Perl, PHP, Java, Python, TCL, VB6.

The programming language is determined via the file extension(s).

The script automatically ignores any file in typical 'not source code' directories, such as `node_modules` or `.git`.

#### options

The -w or --where argument tells the program that for each type of
code it is to list all the directories that contain that type of code.

The -e or --exclude argument excludes certain sub-directories from the
search.  The exclude argument can be used several times on the same
line like this:

The -l or --language option says to only find one language, and not
all of them.

The -p or --pretty option allows the user to select HTML or LaTeX
table output format instead of plain text.
